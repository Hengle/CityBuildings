CityBuildings

## Description
Procedurally generated city with Unity3D.  

*Inspired by [Pixel City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d2-PtK4F6Y)*  

This project's concept is all models are procedural generation.  
I don't have any .fbx or .png  or other files as assets.  
I have generated all assets by GPU program or CPU program.
